# KwikGit

A few shell scripts to make updating single-developer projects easy. Scripts which are destructive are in `CamelCase` to ensure you have to *think* before you enter the command. Don't make my mistakes. To add to your project, copy and past this into the terminal in your project folder into a folder named `git` in your project root:

## Adding the submodule

### Ensure you are using a compatible shell

#### Windows

Use Git-Bash from GitHub. This allows you to use `bash` commands in Windows. I use this personally.

#### Mac

By default, MacOS uses `zsh`, which is broadly compatible with `bash` scripts, in the terminal. I have not had issues with this, but if you run into problems you can change your default shell in the terminal with:

```zsh
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

If you need to change it back, use:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

### Linux

You should be able to use this by default as it seems `bash` is everywhere in the Linux world.

### Without adding to your project repo

*optional*:Create your `.gitignore` if you have not already.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Add the `git/` folder to your .gitignore.

```bash
echo 'git/' >> .gitignore
```

This way you can still use these scripts without uploading them with the rest of your repo files. You will see a warning letting you know that you have added a folder included in your `.gitignore`. Disregard this message.

### Add the submodule to your project

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jauntyjocularjay/KwikGit.git git
```

## Essentials

These are the most important commands in the library.

### New Project Setup

Create Workflow branches, set email, and username

```bash
bash git/branches
```

### Add All, Commit, Push

```bash
bash git/commit
```

Add all new files in the tree, commit changes, add messages, and push changes to the current branch.

### Merge to Dev branch

```bash
bash git/2dev
```

Assuming you are working outside of your `dev` branch, this script adds all new files in the tree, pull changes from origin, commit changes, push changes, then merge with the current branch onto the `dev` branch.

### Merge Dev to Beta branch

```bash
bash git/dev2beta
```

When you are ready to beta-test your changes, merge them into the `beta` branch.

### Merge Beta to Master branch

```bash
bash git/beta2master
```

When your changes in beta are ready for release, merge them to the `master` branch.

### Merge Dev to Master branch

*Warning*: This is dangerous, it will permeate changes to all branches. I *highly* recommond only using this for solo projects.

```bash
bash git/dev2master
```

## Housekeeping

### Pull on all branches

```bash
bash git/fetchall
```

This will stash your changes, fetch updates from your remote `master`, `beta`, and `dev` branches from Github, then re-apply your changes to dev.

### Delete a branch from local and remote

```bash
bash git/DeleteBranch
```

This will delete a branch and remove it from your remote. This way you don't have to worry about stale branches clogging up your remotes.

### Submodules

#### Initialize and update submodules

```bash
bash git/submodules
```
Initializes downloads or updates existing submodules in your project. Very handy when copying repo to a new machine.

#### Remove submodule from your project

```bash
bash git/DeleteSubmodule
```

Removes a submodule for your project. Provide the path from your root to the submodule.

### Remove and re-add Kwik Git

```bash
bash git/readdkg
```

Sometimes you decide you don't like how you set up KwikGit. This will prompt your for your existing KwikGit folder
